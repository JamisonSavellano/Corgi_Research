		<h1>About the Earthquake Data</h1>
		<p>The data in this informational website is from Corgis Data Set Project. It can be found 
			<a href = "https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/earthquakes/">here</a>.
			The data contains statistics about new earthquakes over a month of time. presumably around the date 6/7/16
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>The confusing data units here are magnitude, epoche, gap and significance. Magnitude is the strength of the earth quake and for this data is measured on the 
		Richter Scale. The Richter scale is a scale based on the logarithm of the amplitude of the waves an earthquake makes on a seismograph (a machine that
		measures the strength of an earthquake. Each whole number the scale goes up is a power of ten hgiher than the previous number maxing out at 10.0 for earth.

		<p>Epoch is the amount of seconds elapsed since a certain date (January 1st, 1970). Gap is the predicted location accuracy of the earthquake and is measured 
		in degrees. Gap is found by finding the largest angle from the earthquake epicenter from one seismic station to another (again around the epicenter).

		 Significance is the how significant the earthquake is on a scale from 0 to 1000 with the higher the number the more significant the quake. This is 
		 determined by a number of different factors such as magnitude, felt reports, maximun MMI (more or less shaking intensity
